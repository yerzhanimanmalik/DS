Project plan and report:

(50%) 1. Planned: Implement 3d Variational Autoencoder    -    Done: Implemented 3d Autoencoder

(65%) 2. Planned: Obtain latent vectors for fmri task and rest scans     -      Done

(90%) 3. Planned: Clusterize latent vectors into task and rest      -       Done: Classification, since we know true labels (task and rest). 

         P.S. Term clusterization is more apt to the general problem, where we are differentiating brain connectivity networks (e.g. Broca, motor etc)
         
(100%) 4. Planned: Decode avg latent vectors from a group. Calculate validity of classification        -         +/- Done: Calculated accuracy of the classifier
